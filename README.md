# Cupidity

A speed dating app inspired by always open. 

## About the app

The app is made in flutter.
It is connected to a firebase database to get all the questions. 
All the questions in the database can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W1wQCZ7IBPJICs6MyJDeZxph21k1lOGThT330iQfDUY/edit?usp=sharing

The app can be found on google play under another name.
Reason for this is that I thought this name is more fitting
